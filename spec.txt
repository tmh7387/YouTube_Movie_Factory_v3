YouTube Movie Factory v3
Research Hub — UI Redesign Specification
This document describes every visual and behavioural change required for the redesigned Research Hub page (
frontend/src/pages/Research.tsx
).  It is intentionally code-free: it describes what the developer should build, not how to build it.
Audience: 
Frontend developer implementing the React/Tailwind changes.
Scope: 
Research page only.  Navigation, Settings, Curation, and Production pages are unchanged.
Change Priority Legend
🔴  REQUIRED
Must be implemented — core functionality or layout skeleton
🟡  ENHANCED
Strong improvement; implement if time allows
🟢  NICE-TO-HAVE
Polish / delight — lowest priority

Layout Architecture
Replace the existing 2-column layout with a fixed 3-column horizontal design
Current state: 
1 narrow sidebar (job list) + 1 wide detail panel requiring heavy vertical scrolling.
Target state: 
3 fixed columns — no horizontal scrolling, minimal vertical scrolling within each column.
1.1  Three-Column Grid
Column A
~22% width
Column B
~40% width
Column C
~38% width
• New project form
• Analysis log (collapsible)
• Log filter controls
• Selected job title + status
• Tab bar (Analysis / Ranking / Sources)
• Active tab content pane
• Discovered source video cards
• Selection checkboxes
• Start Curation CTA
Important: 
All three columns must be independently scrollable within the viewport height.  The page header ("Research Hub" h1) and the column headers stay fixed; only the content inside each column scrolls.
1.2  Column A — Left Panel
Column A is always visible but the Analysis Log section inside it is collapsible (see §2.2).  The column itself never disappears.
Max width
~280 px (approx 22% on a 1280 px viewport)
Background
bg-gray-900 / bg-white/5 (matches existing sidebar style)
Top section
New Video Project form — identical to today's form, no changes
Bottom section
Collapsible Analysis Log (see §2.2)
1.3  Column B — Centre Panel
Centre panel shows the AI narrative and ranking data for the currently selected analysis.
Empty state
Illustration + "Select an analysis" prompt when nothing is selected
Loaded state
Job title, status badge, creation date at the top, then a tab bar
Tab bar
Three tabs: Analysis | Ranking Report | Sources (Sources tab is secondary — primary source view is Column C)
Tab: Analysis
AI Narratives & Synthesis text block (existing purple callout style)
Tab: Ranking
Sortable scoring table (see §3)
Tab: Sources
Mirror of Column C for narrow-viewport fallback only
1.4  Column C — Right Panel
Right panel shows the discovered source videos with selection checkboxes and the Start Curation CTA.
Empty state
Faded placeholder grid of 4 ghost cards
Loaded state
Responsive grid of source video cards (see §4)
Footer
Sticky "Start Curation" bar at the bottom of the column (see §5)
2  
Column A — Analysis Log
Redesign the job list into a collapsible, filterable log
2.1  Log Header Row
Replace the static "Previous Analyses" label with an interactive header:
Left side
Label: "Analysis Log" (10px uppercase, gray-500)
Right side
Two icon buttons side-by-side:
  ↳ Filter icon
Opens the filter popover (§2.3)
  ↳ Chevron icon
Toggles the log collapsed / expanded.  Chevron rotates 180° when collapsed.
2.2  Collapsible Behaviour  🔴  REQUIRED
Expanded (default): 
Log shows the full scrollable list of job entries, max-height 60 vh with internal scroll.
Collapsed: 
Log collapses to show only its header row (about 36 px tall). Column A shrinks accordingly but the New Project form above stays visible.
Persist state: 
Store collapsed/expanded state in localStorage so it survives page refresh.
Animation: 
Smooth height transition (200 ms ease-out) when expanding/collapsing.
2.3  Log Filter Controls  🟡  ENHANCED
A compact filter bar slides in below the log header when the filter icon is clicked:
Status filter
Multi-select pill buttons: All | Completed | Searching | Analyzing | Failed | Pending
Clear button
"Clear all" text link — resets filter to All and removes all pinned failure entries
Behaviour
Filter applies client-side to the already-fetched jobs list; no API call needed
2.4  Failed Job Entry Treatment  🔴  REQUIRED
Failed entries need more information and a recovery action.  Each failed job card must show:
Red left-border accent (border-l-2 border-red-500)
Job name (truncated) + red FAILED badge
Error reason in small text — one line, e.g. "YouTube quota exceeded" or "No transcripts found"
A Retry button (small, ghost style) that re-fires the same topic through the API
A Dismiss (×) icon button that removes the entry from the visible list (client-side hide, not API delete)
Data source for error reason: 
The backend already returns an error_message field on failed jobs.  Surface it in the card.  Truncate to 60 chars with a tooltip showing the full message on hover.
2.5  Pending / In-Progress Job Entry Treatment
Show a subtle animated pulse border (border-blue-500/50, opacity keyframe animation) instead of a static badge
Show a compact progress label: "Searching…" or "Analyzing…" with a spinning Loader2 icon (12 px)
No dismiss button on in-progress jobs; only a Cancel button that calls the cancel API endpoint if one exists, otherwise disabled
2.6  Selected Job Highlight
Active entry: blue-600/10 background + solid blue-500 right-border (border-r-2) — identical to current behaviour
Clicking a completed job loads its data into Column B and Column C simultaneously
3  
Ranking Report Tab
Sortable table surfacing Gemini scoring data per video
3.1  Tab Placement
The Ranking Report tab sits in the tab bar inside Column B, between "Analysis" and "Sources":
Analysis
Ranking Report
Sources
3.2  Table Columns  🔴  REQUIRED
The table must include the following columns in left-to-right order:
Column
Width
Sortable?
Default Sort
Data field
Format
Notes
Thumbnail + Title
~30%
Title only

3.3  Sort Behaviour
Click column header to sort ascending; click again to sort descending; third click resets to default (Score desc)
Show a small ▲ or ▼ arrow inside the header of the active sort column
All sorting is client-side; do not re-fetch from API
3.4  Score Visualisation  🟡  ENHANCED
Each Gemini Score cell contains two elements:
The numeric score: e.g. "87" in large bold text
A thin horizontal progress bar below it, 100% width of the cell, filled to the score percentage
Colour logic: ≥70 = green-500, 40–69 = amber-500, <40 = red-500
4  
Video Source Cards (Column C)
Rich video cards with stats, checkboxes, and clear YouTube links
4.1  Card Layout  🔴  REQUIRED
Each source video card is a vertical card with three zones:
Zone 1: Thumbnail
Full-width 16:9 image. On hover, a semi-transparent overlay appears with a play-button YouTube link icon centred. The entire thumbnail is an anchor tag opening YouTube in a new tab.
Zone 2: Stats bar
Single row below the thumbnail: Views | Likes | Duration | Gemini Score.  Each stat is an icon + value pair.  Colour the score with the same green/amber/red logic as the table.
Zone 3: Metadata
Video title (2 lines max, gray-200).  Channel name (gray-500, 10px).  Published year (gray-600, 10px, right-aligned).
4.2  Selection Checkbox  🔴  REQUIRED
A checkbox appears in the top-left corner of each card (overlaid on the thumbnail):
Default state: small semi-transparent circle (white/20 background)
Hover state: circle becomes white/40
Checked state: filled blue-600 circle with a white checkmark icon
Selecting a card here also checks its row in the Ranking Report table, and vice versa (shared state)
Max 5 cards can be selected simultaneously; attempting to select a 6th shows a brief inline toast: "Maximum 5 sources — deselect one first"
4.3  Card Grid Layout
Default
2 columns × N rows inside Column C
When collapsed log
Still 2 columns; Column C width does not change when Column A log collapses
Card border
border border-white/10, rounded-xl — identical to existing card style
Selected card
border-blue-500 border-2 + subtle blue-600/10 background tint
4.4  YouTube Link Clarity  🟡  ENHANCED
Thumbnail overlay shows the YouTube icon (red) + "Watch on YouTube" label, not just an external link arrow
Video ID badge at the bottom of the card is also a hyperlink (monospace text, underlined on hover)
5  
Start Curation — CTA Redesign
Replace the top-right button with a sticky footer bar inside Column C
5.1  Sticky Footer Bar  🔴  REQUIRED
Remove the existing top-right "Start Curation" button.  Instead, add a sticky footer bar pinned to the bottom of Column C:
Visibility
Always visible once a job is selected; greyed out / disabled when 0 videos are selected
Selection count
Left side: "X of 5 sources selected" (X updates reactively as user checks/unchecks cards)
CTA button
Right side: "Curate Selected →" — green-600, disabled-opacity-50 when count = 0
Disabled tooltip
On hover when disabled: "Select at least one source video to continue"
Enabled action
Clicking fires curationService.startCuration(jobId, selectedVideoIds) and navigates to /curation
API Note: 
The selectedVideoIds array should contain the video_id strings from the checked cards, not the internal UUID of research_videos.  Confirm the backend curation endpoint accepts these IDs in the selected_video_ids body field.
5.2  Removed Element
The top-right 
Start Curation
 button that currently appears in the Column B header when a job is completed must be 
removed entirely
.  The sticky Column C footer bar replaces it completely.
6  
Column B — Tab Bar & Analysis Tab
Tabbed detail panel replaces the current flat scroll layout
6.1  Tab Bar
Tabs
Analysis  |  Ranking Report  |  Sources
Active tab style
Blue-600 background, white text, bottom border removed (merges with content)
Inactive tab style
Transparent background, gray-400 text, hover: white/5 background
Tab bar position
Directly below the job title / status header, full width of Column B
Default active tab
"Analysis" when a job is first selected
6.2  Analysis Tab Content
Identical to the current AI Narratives & Synthesis section, with minor improvements:
Retain: 
Purple-900/10 background, purple-500/20 border, italic text, whitespace-pre-wrap
Add: 
Word count indicator in top-right corner of the text block (e.g. "~340 words") in gray-500
Add: 
"Copy" icon button in top-right that copies the full narrative to clipboard with a brief "Copied!" confirmation
6.3  Sources Tab
The Sources tab inside Column B is a simplified list view (not a grid) intended as a fallback for narrow viewports or when the user wants a compact reference alongside the analysis text:
Show a simple numbered list of video titles with their YouTube links
This tab is secondary — the primary source interaction happens in Column C
6.4  Job Header (top of Column B)
Job title
Large (text-2xl bold) — truncated at 1 line with tooltip for overflow
Row 2
Status badge + creation date ("Created Jan 14, 2025") + video count ("9 sources found")
Background
bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900/10 to-transparent, subtle top accent line (border-t-2 border-blue-500/30)
7  
Empty & Loading States
Ensure every state is handled gracefully
7.1  No Job Selected (All three columns)
Column A
No change from current — form is always visible
Column B
Centred illustration + "Select an analysis from the log →" text + subtle arrow pointing left
Column C
2×2 ghost card grid (skeleton loaders, animated pulse) + faded label "Discovered Sources will appear here"
7.2  Job Loading (After selection, before data arrives)
Column B
Full-height skeleton: title bar skeleton + 3 tab skeletons + content area skeleton (3 text lines)
Column C
Same ghost card grid as empty state, but with a "Loading sources…" label
7.3  In-Progress Jobs (searching / analyzing)
Column B Analysis tab
Show partial narrative if available, else progress message with animated spinner
Column C
Show whatever videos have been discovered so far; add a "Finding more sources…" banner at the top of the grid
Auto-refresh
Column B and C both re-poll every 3 s while the job status is not completed/failed — existing behaviour retained
7.4  Failed Job (Column B)
When a failed job is selected:
Column B shows a red error state with the error_message prominently displayed
A "Retry this topic" button (same style as the current Start Curation button) fires a new research job with the same genre_topic
Column C shows an empty ghost grid
