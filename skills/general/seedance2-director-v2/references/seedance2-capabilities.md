# Seedance 2.0 — Master Reference

## What Seedance 2.0 Actually Is

ByteDance's cinematic AI video model released February 2026. Accepts text, image,
video, and audio as inputs simultaneously. Generates up to 15 seconds at 1080p.
The engine that went viral for clips that look like real Hollywood productions.

## TWO GENERATION MODES — Know Which You're Writing For

### TEXT-TO-VIDEO (T2V)
- Pure text prompt. No reference image.
- Character is described entirely in words within the prompt.
- Best for: viral content, action, anime, comedy, cinematic scenes
- Character consistency challenge: harder — use strong anchor words every shot

### IMAGE-TO-VIDEO (I2V)
- Upload reference image(s) + write prompt
- `@image1` tags the primary character reference
- `@image2` tags secondary character or environment
- Best for: consistent characters across scenes, personal videos, branded content
- Character consistency: much better — @image anchors the face/body geometry

## THE OMNI REFERENCE FORMAT (@image system)

This is the heydin.ai / professional creator standard for I2V prompts.

```
[HEADER: CHARACTER & SET DETAILS]

@image1: [Full description of what's in the reference image —
         physical traits, clothing with fabric details, props,
         demeanor. Write it as if describing the image to someone
         who can't see it.]

@image2: [Second reference if applicable]

SFX & ENVIRONMENT: [Location, time, atmosphere, lighting conditions]

SHOT 1: [Shot Type Name]
@image1 [action]. [Camera type + movement]. [Speed]. [Depth of field].
[Sound description]. [Music: yes/no]

SHOT 2: [Shot Type Name]
@image1 [action]. [Camera]. [Speed]. [Sound]. [Music]

[Continue...]
```

**Key rules for @image prompts:**
- Describe the reference image accurately — Seedance reads this as the consistency anchor
- Specify speed as fps: "slow motion (approx. 60fps rendered at 24fps)"
- Always state "No Music" or "Music: [describe tempo and feel]" — Seedance generates audio
- Camera shake: "handheld with aggressive camera shake" vs "handheld, subtle"
- Every shot = its own paragraph with all 5 elements

## THE VIRAL T2V FORMULA

Structure that consistently produces viral Seedance videos:

```
VISUAL STYLE: [One sentence — render quality + camera aesthetic + genre mood]

CHARACTERS: [Precise physical description of everyone on screen —
            age, build, skin, hair, clothing with texture, props,
            personality/demeanor that comes through visually]

ENVIRONMENT: [Where + when + atmosphere + active elements (rain, fire, destruction)]

EMOTIONAL TARGET: [The arc from first frame to last — what escalates]

COLOR LOGIC: [Grade name + description]

TIMELINE:
00:00.0–00:01.5: [SECTION NAME — e.g. "HOOK / ENTRY"]
[Camera angle]. [Exact action]. [Lens note if relevant].
SFX: [specific sounds — be precise: "heavy squelching mud, rhythmic breathing"]
Music: [describe or "No Music"]

00:01.5–00:04.0: [SECTION NAME]
[Description] SFX: [sounds]

[Continue to end]
```

## THE HOOK RULE — First 2 Seconds

Every viral Seedance prompt starts mid-action. Never at the beginning.

**Bad hook:** "A warrior stands in a field. He looks at the horizon. Then a monster appears."
**Good hook:** "Camera opens on the warrior already mid-air, a stone column fragment passing one centimeter past his face in slow motion — he grabs it, uses it as a springboard."

**Hook types that work:**
- Character crashes through something into frame
- Already mid-fight — impact just landing
- POV drop into chaos with zero setup
- Environmental destruction happening right now
- Character already running from something enormous

## NATIVE CAMERA CONTROLS

Always use exact names — Seedance recognizes these:

| What You Write | What It Does |
|----------------|-------------|
| `static camera` | Zero movement — locked tripod |
| `locked off` | Same as static |
| `handheld, subtle` | Light organic sway — intimacy |
| `handheld with aggressive camera shake` | Fight impact feel |
| `slow dolly in` | Tension build |
| `fast dolly in` | Urgency/attack |
| `slow dolly out` / `pull back` | Isolation/endings |
| `pan left` / `pan right` | Follow/reveal |
| `tilt up` / `tilt down` | Power/defeat |
| `low-angle tracking shot` | Ground-level action follow |
| `side-profile tracking shot` | Classic action side view |
| `slow orbit left` / `orbit right` | Product/wonder |
| `tracking shot` | Follows at same distance |
| `slow crane up` | Transcendence/endings |
| `whip pan` | Energy shift/time cut |
| `speed ramping: real-time → slow-motion → real-time` | Impact emphasis |
| `Speed ramping: real-time approach, transitioning into extreme slow motion during [peak], then returning to real-time` | Phil Franco format |

---

## SPEED — WRITE IT PRECISELY

**Bad:** "slow motion"
**Good:** "slow-motion (approx. 20-25% speed)" or "approximately 60fps rendered at 24fps"

Speed categories:
- Normal: real-time
- Light slow: 50% speed (approx. 48fps → 24fps)
- Medium slow: 30% speed
- Heavy slow: 20-25% speed (approx. 120fps → 24fps)
- Extreme slow: 10-15% speed (approx. 240fps → 24fps)

---

## AUDIO — ALWAYS SPECIFY

Seedance generates audio with video. You must direct the sound design.

**Sound design layers:**
1. Ambient environment (wind, rain, crowd, machine hum)
2. Action SFX (footsteps on specific surface, impact type, weapon sound)
3. Character audio (breathing, grunt, dialogue)
4. Music: "No Music" OR describe: "low industrial hum" / "playful light piano" / "sub-bass thump"

**Critical:** Write `No Music` explicitly if you don't want music. Seedance will add music if you don't specify.

## CHARACTER CONSISTENCY RULES

### For @image (I2V) mode:
- **Best reference image:** Front-facing, full body, neutral pose, plain background
- **Anchor words:** Pick 5 physical descriptors and repeat in every shot containing this character
- **Safe angles:** Front, 3/4, side profile
- **Risky angles:** Extreme bird's eye, extreme dutch angle (avoid for face shots)
- **Forbidden words:** "realistic", "photographic", "normal proportions" — these override style

### For pure text (T2V) mode:
- Describe character ONCE in the CHARACTERS block
- In each shot, reference by name + 2-3 anchor words minimum
- Use `@image1` tag even in text descriptions to signal the AI which character
- Keep clothing identical across shots unless explicitly changed

---

## SMART CUTS — WHEN TO USE

**ON:** Any video over 8 seconds needing multiple camera angles
**OFF:** Single continuous shot (macro pour, ECU hold, product orbit)

With Smart Cuts ON, describe your shot sequence:
`"Wide establishing shot transitioning to medium close-up, then cutting to extreme close-up on [detail]"`

## WHAT SEEDANCE 2.0 DOES BEST

1. Multi-shot sequences with Smart Cuts — coherent camera logic automatically
2. Cloth and hair physics — robes, capes, fabric movement exceptional
3. Fluid dynamics — water, tea, fire, smoke, blood
4. Action choreography — fights, chases, impacts
5. Speed ramping — slow-mo on impact is a Seedance signature
6. Facial expressions — emotional micro-reactions
7. Environment destruction — collapsing, shattering, crumbling
8. Character consistency with @image reference

## WHAT TO AVOID

- "Zoom in" → use `slow dolly in` or `fast dolly in`
- "Slow motion" → use "approximately 20% speed"
- "Show the scene" → describe exactly what the camera sees
- Too many effects stacked (4+ degrades quality)
- Starting at the beginning of a story (start mid-action)
- Forgetting audio direction (always specify)
